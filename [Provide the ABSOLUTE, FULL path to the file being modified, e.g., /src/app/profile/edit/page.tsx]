Provide the ENTIRE, FINAL, intended content of the file here.
    Do NOT provide diffs or partial snippets.
    Ensure all code is properly escaped within the CDATA section if necessary (though CDATA handles most special characters like <, >, &).
    If the content itself contains ']]>', it must be broken up (e.g., ']' + ']' + '>').
    The content must be the complete file content from the first line to the last.
