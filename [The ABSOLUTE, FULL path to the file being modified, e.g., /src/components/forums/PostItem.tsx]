The ENTIRE, FINAL, intended content of the file goes here.
    This means if I'm changing just one line in a 100-line file,
    I must provide all 100 lines with that one line corrected.
    All code, including special characters like <, >, &, must be correctly
    escaped within the CDATA section, or simply be part of the text content if
    the CDATA itself handles it (which it does for most code).
    Ensure no part of this content itself contains the CDATA closing sequence ']]>'.
    If it does, it needs to be handled by breaking it (e.g., ']' + ']'+ '>').
